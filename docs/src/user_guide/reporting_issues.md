# Reporting issues

As CedarEDA is currently alpha software, there are many issues, some known others unknown.
We are very excited for you to engage with us on the possibilities of this new tool, but recognize that things may break in new and interesting ways.
For all product feedback, either engage with us on the `#cedar-alpha` channel in [the JuliaLang slack](https://julialang.org/slack/), or open an issue on our [public issue tracker](https://github.com/CedarEDA/PublicIssues).

Commercial users are welcome to file support issues through their regular support mechanism.
