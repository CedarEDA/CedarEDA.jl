<h1>Welcome to CedarEDA</h1>

CedarEDA is a fresh approach to analog circuit
simulation and verification. Thank you for
being among the first users to adopt this new
technology.

<h2>Cedar Release Notes v0.4</h2>

<h3>What's New?</h3>

<h4>End-to-End Derivatives</h4>

<p>
Derivatives now extend to user-defined functions through
Automatic Differentiation (AD), enhancing design insights and optimization reliability.
</p>
<p>
Example in <code>examples (read-only)/Filter/RC/README.md</code> is an
RC circuit that calculates the derivative of risetime relative to capacitance and
verifies it versus the analytical solution vs time.
</p>

<h4>Optimization with Derivatives and Custom Cost Function</h4>

<p>
Derivative-aware optimizers enhance efficiency and convergence reliability
by utilizing sensitivity information.
Users can now define custom cost functions for tailored optimization strategies.
</p>
<p>
Example in <code>examples (read-only)/07_impedance_matcher_sensitivity/README.md</code> is a
simple model of a transmission line that optimizes impedance matching using a
custom cost function.
</p>


<h4>AC Analysis Support</h4>

<p>
Introduced <code>ac!(sp)</code> function for AC analysis,
enabling frequency response calculations through operating point solution and circuit linearization.
</p>
<p>
Example in <code>examples (read-only)/01_butterworth/README.md</code> demonstrates using AC
analysis for filter design.
</p>

<h4>DC Analysis Support</h4>

<p>
Implemented <code>dc!(sp)</code> function for a separate DC analysis,
allowing multi-dimensional parameter sweeping.
</p>
<p>
Example in <code>examples (read-only)/04_fac14/ota/M1_T/dc.jl</code> does a DC sweep of an
Operation Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) from the FAC'14 set of testcases.
</p>

<h4>SPICE Feature Improvements</h4>

Enhanced parser and support for additional constructs, including new
<code>PULSE</code> source and math functions
(<code>arctan</code>,
 <code>asinh</code>,
 <code>acosh</code>,
 <code>atanh</code>,
 <code>ln</code>,
 <code>int</code>,
 <code>floor</code>,
 <code>ceil</code>,
 <code>pow</code>).
FAC14 test case coverage is about 50%. The major features remaining are dependent source types and reading in external Verilog-A files.

<h4>Improved Signal Access</h4>

<p>
Interactive discovery of all possible saved signals from a simulation,
accessible through the interactive terminal.
This can be accessed via tabbing into the hierarchy as in <code>tran1.tran.R1.&lt;tab&gt;</code>
which shows the names of the output variables associated with the top-level resistor <code>R1</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>inspect(signal)</code> function was introduced for convenient signal
or measurement plotting.
By default a measure will show a scalar value and if it is underlined then it
can be plotting with <code>inspect(measure_or_signal)</code>.
</p>


<h2>Cedar v0.3.0 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>What's new?</h3>

<h4>1. Improved start-up times by 2x to 10x</h4>

<p>
    The initial start-up time used to take between 7 to 30 minutes.
    With the new release the times have been improved to 3 to 7 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    The initial start-up time has been improved by reducing the images size,
    using drives with hot caches, caching precompiled files.
    The first start-up will be a litt slower as it has to cache files but future times
    will be faster.
</p>


<h4>2. Removed confusing notifications</h4>

<p>
    Previously there would be about a dozen notifications in the task tray that
    were confusing (for example,
    <code>Your application running on port 8088 is available</code>).
</p>
<p>
    There is still an unwanted notification that says <code>JuliaHub: Connecting...</code>
    which will be removed in a future version.
</p>

<h4>3. Better Logging</h4>

Log messages have been improved for each stage of the simulation process, such as:
<ul>
<li>Simulator version information</li>
<li>CPU statistics</li>
<li>Parsing information:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Name of parsed files</li>
    <li>Ignored netlist statements</li>
    <li>Device statistics</li>
    <li>Netlist parameters with default values</li>
</ul>
<li>Compiling information</li>
<li>Solver Information</li>
<ul>
    <li>Progress bar with ETA</li>
    <li>Detailed stats for CPU/memory/time of each stage</li>
</ul>
<li>There is also a more vebose log file</li>
</ul>

<h4>
4. End-to-end derivatives including all state variables
</h4>

Now any state variable can be selected for solving derivatives while
previously only the simulator selected state variables were available.


<h4>
    5. New <code>examples (read-only)</code> folder
</h4>

The new examples folder will be auto-updated each release and the files
are not editable.
User's own work should go into a separate folder by dragging and dropping the folder
while pressing the <code>Alt</code> key.

<h2>Quick Start - Butterworth Filter Example</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In this guide, we will show you how to interact with the development environment
and get started with CedarEDA.
This interface is a web-based version of VSCode, hosted and served by JuliaHub.

</p>
<p>
This circuit demonstrates a Butterworth filter of third order, implemented with two inductors, a capacitor and a resistor.
The default parameter values are designed to give a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz, however with experimentation different cutoff
 frequencies and step responses are achievable.
</p>

<p>
In this circuit the input is a sinusoidal voltage source (with adjustable frequency) and the output is the filtered output,
as shown in the attached circuit diagram.
We expect for all parameter configurations for higher frequencies to have a lower amplitude, due to the nature of a lowpass filter.
</p>

<h3>Running the Simulation</h3>

<p>
    The Butterworth example loads a SPICE netlist and varies four of the SPICE <code>.parameters</code>, running 20736 simulations.
    The simulation sweep takes about 1 minute to complete.
</p>

<p>
    To run a complete script click the &#9205 button in the top right.
    As the scripts runs, the commands are pasted into the julia Terminal (REPL) at the bottom of the window and executed:

<h3>Exploring Parametric Results</h3>

The results can be explored interactively by pressing <code>shift+enter</code> on the <code>explore(sm, tspan, sp)</code> line.
In VSCode with the Julia extension <code>shift+enter</code> will run the currently selected line.
