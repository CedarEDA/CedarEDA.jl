<h1>Cedar v0.3.0 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>What's new?</h2>

<h3>1. Improved start-up times by 2x to 10x</h3>

<p>
    The initial start-up time used to take between 7 to 30 minutes.
    With the new release the times have been improved to 3 to 7 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    The initial start-up time has been improved by reducing the images size,
    using drives with hot caches, caching precompiled files.
    The first start-up will be a litt slower as it has to cache files but future times
    will be faster.
</p>


<h3>2. Removed confusing notifications</h3>

<p>
    Previously there would be about a dozen notifications in the task tray that
    were confusing (for example,
    <code>Your application running on port 8088 is available</code>).
</p>
<p>
    There is still an unwanted notification that says <code>JuliaHub: Connecting...</code>
    which will be removed in a future version.
</p>

<h3>3. Better Logging</h3>

Log messages have been improved for each stage of the simulation process, such as:
<ul>
<li>Simulator version information</li>
<li>CPU statistics</li>
<li>Parsing information:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Name of parsed files</li>
    <li>Ignored netlist statements</li>
    <li>Device statistics</li>
    <li>Netlist parameters with default values</li>
</ul>
<li>Compiling information</li>
<li>Solver Information</li>
<ul>
    <li>Progress bar with ETA</li>
    <li>Detailed stats for CPU/memory/time of each stage</li>
</ul>
<li>There is also a more vebose log file</li>
</ul>

<h3>
4. End-to-end derivatives including all state variables
</h3>

Now any state variable can be selected for solving derivatives while
previously only the simulator selected state variables were available.


<h3>
    5. New <code>examples (read-only) folder</code>
</h3>

The new examples folder will be auto-updated each release and the files
are not editable.
User's own work should go into a separate folder by dragging and dropping the folder
while pressing the <code>Alt</code> key.
